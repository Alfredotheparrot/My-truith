# Learning to code

I learned to code by mostly myself, and my programming dad.
Firstly, I was learning to code using Tynker at age 5-7 then
as I grew older from 7-9 I started using Scratch. After when 
I grew from 9-11 I actually started using programming 
languages like Python. During these ages I made my first
minecraft minigame although it was bad and horribly
programming it brought me courage to be a full time
programmer.

**Programming Languages**

Sometime after, I got bored of making minecraft "Minigames"
and I started learning to use other programming languages
like C++, Java, Javascript, Ruby, Html+Css and a lot more.
My main reasoning for "learning" a lot of programming languages
is my curiosity for programming.

**Minigames**


After this, I began to create full on interactable websites
which powered my love for programming even more than learning
programming languages.

**My Plan**

Although, I have no true plan for programming to take 
me somewhere in life it truley does make me feel happy
and anytime I get bored I look forward to programming.
